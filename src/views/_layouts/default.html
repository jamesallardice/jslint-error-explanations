                    <a href="http://jslint.com">JSLint</a> and the popular fork of it, <a href="http://jshint.com/">JSHint</a>, seem to be proud of the fact that they will "hurt your feelings". Well that's OK, but it would be nice if it made it a bit clearer why they were hurting them.

                    This site is still a work in progress. Not all JSLint or JSHint error messages are documented here yet. The code is all <a href="https://github.com/jamesallardice/jslint-error-explanations">available on GitHub</a> if you would like to help out! Alternatively, you can request an article for a specific error message by <a href="http://www.jamesallardice.com/contact/">contacting me</a> or raising an <a href="https://github.com/jamesallardice/jslint-error-explanations/issues">issue on GitHub</a>.
