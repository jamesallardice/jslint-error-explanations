	<h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
	JSHint will throw the "Function declarations should not be placed in blocks" error when it encounters <strong>a function declaration inside a block statement</strong>. In the following example we attempt to declare the <span class="code">example</span> function if some condition evaluates to <span class="code">true</span>.
</p>
<p>
	This is the JSHint equivalent of the "<a href="/function-statements-should-not-be-placed-in-blocks">Function statements should not be placed in blocks</a>" error from JSLint. More detail can be found on the page for the JSLint message.
