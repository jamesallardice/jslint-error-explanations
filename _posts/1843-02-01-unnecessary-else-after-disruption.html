    <h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p class="standout">
    This is a new and improved version of the old JSLint <a href="/unexpected-else-after-return">"Unexpected 'else' after 'return'"</a> warning. More details may be found on the page for that message.
</p>
<p>
    JSLint (since July 2013) will throw the "Unnecessary 'else' after disruption" error when it encounters <strong>an <span class="code">else</span> block following an <span class="code">if</span> block that contains a disruptive statement such as <span class="code">return</span> or <span class="code">throw</span></strong>. Here's some example code:
</p>
<textarea>
function example(x) {
    "use strict";
    if (!x) {
        throw "A throw is disruptive";
    } else {
        return true;
    }
}</textarea>
<p>
    <h3>Why do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    This error is raised to highlight a <strong>completely pointless piece of code</strong>. If execution enters the <span class="code">if</span> block, the flow of execution will be disrupted (it could for example return or throw an exception). There will be no way execution can enter the <span class="code">else</span> block. Therefore, you can simply omit the <span class="code">else</span> block and place its contents directly after the <span class="code">if</span> block. Here's the above snippet again, without the error:
</p>
<textarea>
function example(x) {
    "use strict";
    if (!x) {
        throw "A throw is disruptive";
    }
    return true;
}</textarea>
