    <h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    JSLint will throw the "Function statements should not be placed in blocks" error when it encounters <strong>a function declaration inside a block statement</strong>. In the following example we attempt to declare the <span class="code">example</span> function if some condition evaluates to <span class="code">true</span>:
</p>
<textarea>
var x = true;
if (x) {
    function example() {
        "use strict";
    }
}</textarea>

    <h3>Why do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    This error is raised to highlight <strong>code that may not work as you expect it to</strong>. Your code will run without error, but certain situations could cause unexpected behaviour.
</p>
<p>
    Function declarations (or "function statements" as they are called in the JSLint error message) are <em>hoisted</em> to the top of the scope in which they appear, as described by Declaration Binding Instantiation (<a href="http://es5.github.com/#x10.5" target="_blank">ES5 &sect;10.5</a>). Therefore, it is not possible to conditionally declare a function with a function statement. The above example is actually interpreted as follows:
</p>
<textarea>
function example() {
    "use strict";
}
var x = true;
if (x) {}</textarea>
<p>
    As you can see, regardless of the result of the condition, the <span class="code">example</span> function is always declared. If you were to, for example, declare it twice (once in an <span class="code">if</span> block and once in the corresponding <span class="code">else</span> block) you would actually end up with the second declaration overwriting the first regardless of the result of the condition.
</p>
<p>
    Since <em>assignments</em> are not hoisted (they happen where you expect them to), if you want to declare a function conditionally, you can use a function <em>expression</em>, instead of a function declaration. A function expression is just an assignment:
</p>
<textarea>
var x = true,
    example;
if (x) {
    example = function () {
        "use strict";
    };
}</textarea>
