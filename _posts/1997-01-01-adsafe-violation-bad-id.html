    <h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    JSLint (prior to version 2013-03-18) throws the "ADSAFE violation: bad id" error when the <span class="code">adsafe</span> and <span class="code">fragment</span> options are set to <span class="code">true</span> (they're <span class="code">false</span> by default) and <strong>you pass it a fragment of HTML that includes a <span class="code">div</span> element with an <span class="code">id</span> attribute value that does not conform to the ADsafe rules</strong>. Here's an example:
</p>
<textarea data-jslintopts='{ "adsafe": true, "fragment": true }' data-file="jslint-20130205.min.js">
&lt;div id="adsafe-widget"&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
        ADSAFE.go("adsafe-widget", function () {
            "use strict";
        });
    &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</textarea>
<p>
    <h3>Why do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    This error is raised when JSLint encounters code that <strong>violates the rules of the ADsafe subset of JavaScript</strong>. It is a fatal error that signifies a severe problem with ADsafe code and will have to be fixed before your ADsafe code will execute.
</p>
<p>
    ADsafe widgets must be wrapped in a <span class="code">div</span> element. The <a href="http://www.adsafe.org/widget.html" target="_blank">ADsafe widget documentation</a> states the following:
</p>
<blockquote>
    The <span class="code">&lt;div&gt;</span> element must have an <span class="code">id</span>. The <span class="code">id</span> must contain only upper case ASCII letters with a trailing _ character.
</blockquote>

    In a commit on 20th March 2013, HTML, CSS and ADsafe parsing functionality was removed from JSLint. If you rely upon this functionality, you will be unable to upgrade JSLint to a version beyond that date.
