    <h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    JSHint (version 1.0.0 and above) will throw the "Wrapping non-IIFE function literals in parens is unnecessary" error when it encounters <strong>a function expression wrapped in parentheses with no following invoking parentheses</strong>, but only <strong>if the <span class="code">immed</span> option is set to <span class="code">true</span></strong>. In the following example we assign a function expression to a variable <span class="code">x</span>:
</p>
<textarea data-linter="JSHint">
/*jshint immed: true */
var x = (function () {
    "use strict";
    return 10;
});</textarea>
<p>
    This is the equivalent of the JSLint and older JSHint "<a href="/do-not-wrap-function-literals-in-parens-unless-they-are-immediately-invoked">Do not wrap function literals in parens unless they are to be immediately invoked</a>" warning. More detail can be found on the page for that message.

    If you have not come across the acronym "IIFE" before, you may be interested in <a href="http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/" target="_blank">Ben Alman's article on the subject</a>, in which he coins the term to stand for "Immediately Invoked Function Expression".

<p class="standout">
    In JSHint 1.0.0 and above you have the ability to ignore any warning with a <a href="http://jshint.com/docs/#options" target="_blank">special option syntax</a>. The identifier of this warning is <strong>W068</strong>. This means you can tell JSHint to not issue this warning with the <code>/*jshint -W068 */</code> directive.
