    <h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    JSLint will throw the "Weird assignment" error when it encounters <strong>an assignment expression in which the left hand and right hand side expressions are "similar"</strong>. In the following example we declare a variable <span class="code">x</span> and then attempt to assign it to itself:
</p>
<textarea>
var x = 10;
x = x;</textarea>
<p>
    <h3>Why do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    This error is raised to highlight a <strong>potentially confusing and completely pointless piece of code</strong>. There are no situations in which you would need to assign something to itself.
