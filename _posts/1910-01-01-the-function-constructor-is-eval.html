    <h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    JSLint and JSHint (before version 1.0.0) will throw the "The Function constructor is eval" error when they encounter <strong>a call to the <span class="code">Function</span> constructor function preceded by the <span class="code">new</span> operator</strong>. Here's a simple example which defines a function to add two numbers:
</p>
<textarea>
var x = new Function("a", "b", "return a + b");</textarea>
<p>
    <h3>Why do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    This error is raised to highlight the use of a <strong>bad practice</strong>. By passing a string to the <span class="code">Function</span> constructor, you are requiring the engine to parse that string much in the way it has to when you call the <span class="code">eval</span> function. For full details of why this is a problem, see the article on the related message, "<a href="/eval-is-evil">eval is evil</a>".
</p>
<p>
    In simple cases like that of our example above, you can fix the issue by using a <em>function declaration</em> or <em>function expression</em>:
</p>
<textarea>
var x = function (a, b) {
    "use strict";
    return a + b;
};</textarea>
<p>
    In more advanced cases where you really need to use the <span class="code">Function</span> constructor, you can set the <span class="code">evil</span> option to <span class="code">true</span> to prevent both JSLint and JSHint from complaining about it:
</p>
<textarea>
/*jslint evil: true */
var x = new Function("a", "b", "return a + b");</textarea>
<p class="standout">
    In JSHint 1.0.0 and above this warning has changed to "<a href="/the-function-constructor-is-a-form-of-eval">The Function constructor is a form of eval</a>". More detail can be found the page dedicated to that message.
