	<h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
	JSHint will throw the "'{a}' is not a statement label" error when it encounters <strong>a <span class="code">break</span> or <span class="code">continue</span> statement referencing a label that does not exist</strong>. In the following example we try to break out of a <span class="code">for</span> loop to the <span class="code">example</span> label.
</p>
<p>
	This is the JSHint equivalent of the "<a href="/a-is-not-a-label">'{a}' is not a label</a>" error from JSLint. More detail can be found on the page for the JSLint message.
