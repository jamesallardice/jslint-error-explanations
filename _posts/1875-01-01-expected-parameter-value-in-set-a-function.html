    <h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    JSLint will throw the "Expected parameter (value) in set '{a}' function" error when it encounters <strong>multiple named arguments in the signature of a property setter function, none of which have the identifier <span class="code">value</span></strong>. In the following example we create an object <span class="code">x</span> with a getter and setter. The getter will always return half of the set value (since getters and setters are an ECMAScript 5 feature we need to set the <span class="code">es5</span> option, otherwise JSLint will not recognise them):

var x = {
    real: 10,
    get x () {
        "use strict";
        return this.real / 2;
    },
    set x (val, y) {
        "use strict";
        this.real = val;
    }

    <h3>Why do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    This error is raised to highlight a <strong>lack of convention</strong> and a <strong>completely pointless piece of code</strong>. Your code will run without error if you do not change it, but could be confusing to other developers and adds unnecessary bytes to the weight of your script.
</p>
<p>
    ECMAScript 5 added new syntax for object property getter and setter functions. The specification states the following in reference to getters (<a href="http://es5.github.com/#x8.6.1" target="_blank">ES5 &sect;8.6.1</a>):
</p>
<blockquote>The functionâ€™s [[Call]] internal method... is called with an arguments list containing the assigned value as its sole argument each time a set access of the property is performed.</blockquote>
<p>
    Since the runtime will only ever pass a single argument to the function, there is no need to provide more than one named argument in the function signature. By convention, this single argument should be named <span class="code">value</span>, since it will be used to set the value of something. To fix this error, simply remove any additional named arguments, and rename the first one to <span class="code">value</span>:
