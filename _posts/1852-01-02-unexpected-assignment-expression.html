    <h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    JSLint (since July 2013) will throw this error when a clause exists in a <span class="code">while</span>, <span class="code">for</span>, or <span class="code">if</span> that contains an ambiguous assignment operator where a comparison operator could exist. This is a newer version of the old "<a href="/expected-a-conditional-expression-and-saw-an-assignment">Expected a conditional expression and instead saw an assignment</a>" JSLint and JSHint message:

<textarea>
var x;
if (x = 0) {
    var b = 1;
}
