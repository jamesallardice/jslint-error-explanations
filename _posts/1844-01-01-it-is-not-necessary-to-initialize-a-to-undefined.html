    <h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    JSLint and JSHint will throw the "It is not necessary to initialize '{a}' to 'undefined'" error when they encounter <strong>a variable statement in which the variable is explicitly initialized to <span class="code">undefined</span></strong>. Here's an example in which we attempt to declare a variable <span class="code">x</span> and assign <span class="code">undefined</span> to it:
</p>
<textarea>
var x = undefined;</textarea>
<p>
    <h3>Why do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    This error is raised to highlight <strong>a completely pointless piece of code</strong>. Your code will run without error if you do not change it, but you're needlessly increasing the size of your script. 
</p>
<p>
    Since variable declarations are hoisted to the top of the scope in which they occur, and assignments happen in the expected place, variables are always initialized to <span class="code">undefined</span> implicitly. The following is what happens when you enter a new scope (<a href="http://es5.github.com/#x10.5" target="_blank">ES5 &sect;10.5</a>):
</p>
<blockquote>8. For each <em>VariableDeclaration</em>... <em>d</em> in source text order do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Let <em>dn</em> be the <em>Identifier</em> in <em>d</em>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Let <em>varAlreadyDeclared</em> be the result of calling <em>env's</em> HasBinding concrete method passing <em>dn</em> as the argument.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. If <em>varAlreadyDeclared</em> is false, then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. Call <em>env's</em> CreateMutableBinding concrete method passing <em>dn</em> and <em>configurableBindings</em> as the arguments.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. Call <em>env's</em> SetMutableBinding concrete method passing <em>dn</em>, undefined, and <em>strict</em> as the arguments.</blockquote>
<p>
    It's the last line that's interesting. Effectively, it creates a binding in the current scope between the given identifier and the value <span class="code">undefined</span>. This shows that every variable has the value <span class="code">undefined</span> when it is created. When the variable statement is actually parsed, it is assigned a value if an assignment expression is present as part of the statement (as it is in our example above). This is further clarified by the following (<a href="http://es5.github.com/#x12.2" target="_blank">ES5 &sect;12.2</a>):
</p>
<blockquote>Variables are initialised to undefined when created. A variable with an <em>Initialiser</em> is assigned the value of its <em>AssignmentExpression</em> when the <em>VariableStatement</em> is executed, not when the variable is created.</blockquote>
<p>
    You can fix the error by simply removing the assignment expression from the variable statement. The variable will still have the same value:
</p>
<textarea>
var x;</textarea>
<p>
    If, for whatever reason, you <em>have</em> to assign something to the variable, you can replace <span class="code">undefined</span> with something that returns the <span class="code">undefined</span> value. The simplest example of that is the <span class="code">void</span> operator:
</p>
<textarea>
var x = void 0;</textarea>
<p>
    If you have overwritten <span class="code">undefined</span> so you're actually assigning a different value to your variable, use a more sensible identifier. There are no JSLint or JSHint options that will surpress this error.
