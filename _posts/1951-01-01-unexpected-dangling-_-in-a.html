    <h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    JSLint will throw the "Unexpected dangling '_' in '{a}'" error when it encounters <strong>an identifier that begins or ends with the underscore character</strong>. JSHint will throw this error in the same situation, but only <strong>if the <span class="code">nomen</span> option is set to <span class="code">true</span></strong>. In the following example we use several such identifiers:
</p>
<textarea>
var _x = 10,
    y = {
        z_: 20
    };

function _test() {
    "use strict";
}</textarea>
<p>
    <h3>Why do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    This error is raised to highlight a <strong>lack of convention</strong>. Your code will run without error if you do not change it, but could be confusing to other developers, and could also indicate a lack of understanding of the language.
</p>
<p>
    Identifiers prefixed with the underscore character are often used to indicate a private variable. Since JavaScript doesn't have a real notion of "private", this can be misleading.
</p>
<p>
    If you're using JSLint, you can fix the error by setting the <span class="code">nomen</span> (short for <em>nomenclature</em>) option to <span class="code">true</span>. Conversely, if you're using JSHint, you can simply remove the same option:
</p>
<textarea>
/*jslint nomen: true */
var _x = 10,
    y = {
        z_: 20
    };

function _test() {
    "use strict";
}</textarea>
<p>
    Alternatively, you can simply remove the underscore character from the start or end of your identifiers (note that use of this character elsewhere in identifiers is accepted):
</p>
<textarea>
var x = 10,
    y = {
        z: 20
    };

function test_with_underscores() {
    "use strict";
}</textarea>
