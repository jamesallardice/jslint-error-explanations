    <h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    JSLint and JSHint will throw the "Do not use {a} as a constructor" error when they encounter <strong>a call to <span class="code">String</span>, <span class="code">Number</span>, <span class="code">Boolean</span>, <span class="code">Math</span> or <span class="code">JSON</span> preceded by the <span class="code">new</span> operator</strong>. In the following example we attempt to assign some values to variables by invoking these functions as constructors:
</p>
<textarea>
var str = new String("hello"),
    num = new Number(10),
    bool = new Boolean(false),
    math = new Math(),
    json = new JSON({ myProp: 10 });</textarea>
<p>
    <h3>Why do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    This error is raised to highlight a <strong>bad practice</strong> and a piece of code that may <strong>not work as you intend it to</strong>. It can also highlight a possible <strong>fatal JavaScript error</strong>. Your code could run without error if you do not change it, but could be confusing to other developers and could also behave in unexpected ways.
</p>
<p>
    The <span class="code">String</span>, <span class="code">Number</span> and <span class="code">Boolean</span> constructor functions return <em>objects</em> of type <span class="code">String</span>, <span class="code">Number</span> and <span class="code">Boolean</span>, which is rarely what you want. Usually, you want <em>literal</em> string, number or boolean values, because strictly comparing an object to a literal will always return <span class="code">false</span>.
</p>
<p>
    In the case of these objects, to fix this error, use literal values rather than their corresponding wrapper objects:
</p>
<textarea>
var str = "hello",
    num = 10,
    bool = false;</textarea>
<p>
    Note that this does not cause you to lose any functionality, since literal values are internally cast to instances of the appropriate type when you call a method on them. Also note that you are free to use these functions to perform type conversions i.e. by invoking them without the <span class="code">new</span> operator:
</p>
<textarea>
var str = String(10);</textarea>
<p>
    The case is a little different for the <span class="code">Math</span> and <span class="code">JSON</span> objects. These two objects are not functions, and cannot be constructed. Attempts to instantiate them will result in a <span class="code">TypeError</span>. If you're trying to serialize an object into a JSON string, you need to use the <span class="code">JSON.stringify</span> method instead:
</p>
<textarea>
var json = JSON.stringify({ myProp: 10 });</textarea>
