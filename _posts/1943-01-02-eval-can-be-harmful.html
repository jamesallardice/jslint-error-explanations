    <h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    JSHint (version 1.0.0 and above) will throw the "eval can be harmful" error when it encounters <strong>an invocation of the <span class="code">eval</span> function</strong>. Here's an example in which we use <span class="code">eval</span> to access an object property:
</p>
<textarea data-linter="JSHint">
var myString = "x",
    myObject = {
        x: 10
    },
    value = eval("myObject." + myString);</textarea>
<p>
    This is the equivalent of the JSLint and older JSHint "<a href="/eval-is-evil">eval is evil</a>" warning. More detail can be found on the page for that message.
</p>
<p class="standout">
    In JSHint 1.0.0 and above you have the ability to ignore any warning with a <a href="http://jshint.com/docs/#options" target="_blank">special option syntax</a>. The identifier of this warning is <strong>W061</strong>. This means you can tell JSHint to not issue this warning with the <code>/*jshint -W061 */</code> directive.
