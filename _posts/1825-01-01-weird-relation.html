    <h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    JSLint will throw the "Weird relation" error when it encounters <strong>a comparison in which the left and right hand sides are "similar"</strong>, or <strong>a comparison in which either the left or right hand side is a string literal and the other is a numeric literal</strong>. In the following example we attempt to compare <span class="code">x</span> with itself:
</p>
<textarea>
var x = 10;
if (x === x) {
    x = 20;
}</textarea>
<p>
    <h3>Why do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    This error is raised to highlight a <strong>potentially confusing and potentially pointless piece of code</strong>. There are almost no situations in which you would need to compare something to itself.
</p>
<p>
    There is, however, one use case for this kind of comparison. Since the special Number value <span class="code">NaN</span> is never equal to itself, you can use a self-comparison to check whether some value is <span class="code">NaN</span>. The following example will return <span class="code">true</span> only if the value is <span class="code">NaN</span>.
</p>
<textarea>
var x = parseInt("x", 10); //Results in NaN
if (x !== x) {
    /* We will only end up in here if 'x' is NaN but
     * JSLint doesn't like it */
    x = 20;
}</textarea>
<p>
    If you are receiving this error for this specific use case, you can either ignore the error and let your script fail the JSLint test, or you can use the built-in <span class="code">isNaN</span> function instead. Here's the above snippet rewritten:
</p>
<textarea>
var x = parseInt("x", 10); //Results in NaN
if (isNaN(x)) {
    /* We will only end up in here if 'x' is NaN and
     * this time JSLint is happy */
    x = 20;
}</textarea>
