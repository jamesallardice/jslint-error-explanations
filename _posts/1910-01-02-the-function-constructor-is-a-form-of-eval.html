    <h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    JSHint (version 1.0.0 and above) will throw the "The Function constructor is a form of eval" error when it encounters <strong>a call to the <span class="code">Function</span> constructor function preceded by the <span class="code">new</span> operator</strong>. Here's a simple example which defines a function to add two numbers:
</p>
<textarea data-linter="JSHint">
var x = new Function("a", "b", "return a + b");</textarea>
<p>
    This is the JSHint 1.0.0 equivalent of the "<a href="/the-function-constructor-is-eval">The Function constructor is eval</a>" error from JSLint and older versions of JSHint. More detail can be found on the page for that message.
</p>
<p class="standout">
    In JSHint 1.0.0 and above you have the ability to ignore any warning with a <a href="http://jshint.com/docs/#options" target="_blank">special option syntax</a>. The identifier of this warning is <strong>W054</strong>. This means you can tell JSHint to not issue this warning with the <code>/*jshint -W054 */</code> directive.
