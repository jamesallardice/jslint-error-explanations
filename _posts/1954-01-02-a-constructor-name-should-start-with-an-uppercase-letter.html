    <h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    JSHint will throw the "A constructor name '{a}' should start with an uppercase letter" error when it encounters <strong>an identifier following the <span class="code">new</span> operator, when the <span class="code">newcap</span> option is set to <span class="code">true</span> and the identifier in question is not an own property of the global object</strong>. In the following example we attempt to instantiate a "class" <span class="code">myClass</span> (we can assume that it has been declared elsewhere):
</p>
<textarea data-linter="JSHint">
/*jshint newcap: true */
var myInstance = new myClass();</textarea>
<p>
    This is the JSHint equivalent of the "<a href="/a-constructor-name-a-should-start-with-an-uppercase-letter">A constructor name '{a}' should start with an uppercase letter</a>" error from JSLint. although it occurs under slightly different circumstances. More detail about the root cause and reasons behind it can be found on the page for the JSLint message.
</p>
<p class="standout">
    In JSHint 1.0.0 and above you have the ability to ignore any warning with a <a href="http://jshint.com/docs/#options" target="_blank">special option syntax</a>. The identifier of this warning is <strong>W055</strong>. This means you can tell JSHint to not issue this warning with the <code>/*jshint -W055 */</code> directive.
