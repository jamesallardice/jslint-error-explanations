    <h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    JSLint and JSHint will throw the "Don't make functions within a loop" error when they encounter <strong>a function statement or expression within a <span class="code">for</span>, <span class="code">while</span> or <span class="code">do</span> statement</strong>. In the following example we attempt to add a click event listener to each element with a given class name. The event handler is intended to overwrite the contents of the clicked element with the value of <span class="code">i</span> at a specific iteration of the loop:
</p>
<textarea>
/*jslint browser: true, plusplus: true */

var elems = document.getElementsByClassName("myClass"), i;

for (i = 0; i < elems.length; i++) {
    elems[i].addEventListener("click", function () {
        "use strict";
        this.innerHTML = i;
    });
}</textarea>
<p>
    <h3>Why do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    This error is raised to highlight a piece of code that <strong>may not work as you expect it to</strong> and could also indicate a <strong>misunderstanding of how the language works</strong>. Your code may run without any problems if you do not fix this error, but in some situations it could behave unexpectedly.
</p>
<p>
    In the example above, when you click on one of the affected elements and trigger the event handler, the content will change to the final value of <span class="code">i</span>. If there are 4 elements in the <span class="code">NodeList</span> referred to by <span class="code">elems</span>, the content of each element will end up being "4".
</p>
<p>
    To work around this, we need to capture the value of <span class="code">i</span> at each iteration of the loop and ensure that it's that value that is referred to by the click event handler bound at this iteration. A common solution is to wrap the body of the loop in an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE), creating a closure that captures the value of the variable:
</p>
<textarea>
/*jslint browser: true, plusplus: true */

var elems = document.getElementsByClassName("myClass"), i;

for (i = 0; i < elems.length; i++) {
    (function (i) {
        "use strict";
        elems[i].addEventListener("click", function () {
            this.innerHTML = i;
        });
    }());
}</textarea>
<p>
    This will work as we expect it to, with each element getting the correct value of <span class="code">i</span>, but it's definitely starting to look messy and becoming harder to read (and therefore harder to maintain). And in any case, since there's still a function within the loop, JSLint and JSHint will still complain. To fix the issue, we need to move the function out of the loop, and maintain the closure:
</p>
<textarea>
/*jslint browser: true, plusplus: true */

var elems = document.getElementsByClassName("myClass"), i;

function makeClickHandler(i) {
    "use strict";
    return function () {
        this.innerHTML = i;
    };
}

for (i = 0; i < elems.length; i++) {
    elems[i].addEventListener("click", makeClickHandler(i));
}</textarea>
