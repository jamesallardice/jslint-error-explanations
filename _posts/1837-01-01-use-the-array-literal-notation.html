    <h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    JSLint and JSHint will throw the "Use the array literal notation []" error when they encounter <strong>a call to the <span class="code">Array</span> constructor with the <span class="code">new</span> operator</strong>. Here's an example:
</p>
<textarea>
var x = new Array();</textarea>
<p>
    <h3>Why do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    This error is raised to highlight a <strong>potentially dangerous and unnecessarily verbose piece of code</strong>. Before we look at why that above snippet is potentially dangerous, here's a rewritten version using array literal notation that passes JSLint and JSHint. Notice that it's significantly shorter:
</p>
<textarea>
var x = [];</textarea>
<p>
    Since the <span class="code">Array</span> constructor is actually just a property of the global object, it can be overwritten. If it has been overwritten, then it's possible the first example above will generate a type error. For example, if you had run something like <span class="code">Array = 50</span>, a type error would be thrown because <span class="code">Array</span> is no longer a function.
</p>
<p>
    Here's an example in which we overwrite the <span class="code">Array</span> constructor. Note that JSLint and JSHint do not know that's what has happened. Therefore, they take the safe approach and forbids the of the <span class="code">Array</span> constructor completely:
</p>
<textarea data-jslintopts='{"browser":true}'>
window.Array = 50;
var x = new Array(); //TypeError: Array is not a function</textarea>
