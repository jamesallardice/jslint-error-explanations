    <h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    JSLint will throw the "Wrap an immediate function invocation in parentheses" error when it encounters <strong>an immediately invoked function expression that is not wrapped in parentheses</strong>. JSHint will throw this error in the same situation, but only <strong>if the <span class="code">immed</span> option is set to <span class="code">true</span></strong>. In the following example we assign the <em>return value</em> of the anonymous function the variable <span class="code">x</span>:
</p>
<textarea>
/*jshint immed: true */
var x = function () {
    "use strict";
    return {
        y: 1
    };
}();</textarea>

    <h3>Why do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    This error is raised to highlight a <strong>lack of convention</strong>. Your code will run fine if you do not fix this error, but it may be confusing to others.
</p>
<p>
    Since function statements cannot be immediately invoked, and function <em>expressions</em> can be, a common technique to create an immediately-invoked function expression is to simply wrap a function statement in parentheses. The opening parentheses causes the contained function to be parsed as an expression, rather than a declaration:
</p>
<textarea>
var x;
(function () {
    "use strict";
    x = 10;
}());</textarea>
<p>
    If you remove the wrapping parentheses from the above example, you will end up with a syntax error. For that reason, when immediately invoking a function expression that doesn't require any special treatment to turn it into an expression (as in the first example above), convention dictates that you should wrap it in parentheses anyway, for consistency and to make it clearer that the resulting value of the overall expression is the <em>return value</em> of the function, rather than a reference to the function itself:
</p>
<textarea>
var x = (function () {
    "use strict";
    return {
        y: 1
    };
}());</textarea>
<p>
    Note that by fixing this error you are likely to end up with the related "<a href="../move-the-invocation-into-the-parens-that-contain-the-function/">Move the invocation into the parens that contain the function</a>" error, which should be very simple to fix at this point.
