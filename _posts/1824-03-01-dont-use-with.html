    <h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    JSHint will throw the "Don't use 'with'" error when it encounters <strong>a use of the <span class="code">with</span> statement</strong> in code that is <strong>not running in strict mode</strong>. Here's an example:
</p>
<textarea data-linter="JSHint">
function example() {
    var a = {
            b: 10
        },
        c = 20;
    with (a) {
        b = 30;
        c = 40;
    }
}</textarea>
<p>
    <h3>Why do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    This is the equivalent of the JSLint "<a href="/unexpected-with">Unexpected 'with'</a>" warning. More detail can be found on the page for that message.
</p>
<p class="standout">
    In JSHint 1.0.0 and above you have the ability to ignore any warning with a <a href="http://jshint.com/docs/#options" target="_blank">special option syntax</a>. The identifier of this warning is <strong>W085</strong>. This means you can tell JSHint to not issue this warning with the <code>/*jshint -W085 */</code> directive.
