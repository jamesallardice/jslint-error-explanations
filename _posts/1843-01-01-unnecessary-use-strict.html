    <h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    JSLint will throw the "Unnecessary use strict" error when it encounters an occurence of <strong>the <span class="code">"use strict"</span> directive in code that is already running in strict mode</strong>. In the following example we have a <span class="code">"use strict"</span> directive in the global scope, and another in the function:
</p>
<textarea>
function Example() {

    //This directive applies to all contained scopes
    "use strict";

    this.method = function () {
        "use strict";
    };
}</textarea>
<p>
    <h3>Why do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    This error is raised to highlight a <strong>completely pointless piece of code</strong>. The <span class="code">"use strict"</span> directive applies to the scope in which it appears, and any descendant execution contexts. Here's what the ECMAScript 5 specification tells us about strict mode and functions (<a href="http://es5.github.com/#x10.1.1" target="_blank">section &sect;10.1.1</a>):
</p>
<blockquote>
    Function code that is part of a <em>FunctionDeclaration</em>, <em>FunctionExpression</em>, or accessor <em>PropertyAssignment</em> is strict function code if its <em>FunctionDeclaration</em>, <em>FunctionExpression</em>, or <em>PropertyAssignment</em> is contained in strict mode code or if the function code begins with a Directive Prologue that contains a Use Strict Directive.
</blockquote>
<p>
    If JSLint throws this error at you, you can safely remove the highlighted instances of the <span class="code">"use strict"</span> directive.
