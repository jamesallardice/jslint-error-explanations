    <h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    JSLint and JSHint will throw the "Unclosed comment" error when they encounter <strong>a multiline comment that does not end with the characters <span class="code">*/</span></strong>. Here's an example:
</p>
<textarea>
/* This is a comment
 * but I forgot to
 * close it.</textarea>
<p>
    <h3>Why do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    This error is raised to highlight a <strong>JavaScript syntax error</strong>. The ECMAScript 5 specification lists the following grammar for multiline comments (<a href="http://es5.github.com/#x7.4" target="_blank">section &sect;7.4</a>):
</p>
<blockquote>
    <em>MultiLineComment</em> ::<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="code">/*</span> <em>MultiLineCommentChars</em><sub>opt</sub> <span class="code">*/</span>
</blockquote>
<p>
    We can see from the above quote that multiline comments must end with the <span class="code">*/</span> characters. If you have an unclosed multiline comment a syntax error will be thrown when the interpreter reaches the end of the file. Here's the above snippet once more, except we've closed the comment this time:
</p>
<textarea>
/* This is a comment
 * but I remembered to
 * close it. */</textarea>
 <p>
    <h4>JSHint bug alert!</h4>
 </p>
 <p>
    As you may have noticed if you have switched one of the example above to use JSHint instead of JSLint, a large number of the same error appear to get generated for the first unclosed comment, to the point where the parser gives up and tells you that there are too many errors.
