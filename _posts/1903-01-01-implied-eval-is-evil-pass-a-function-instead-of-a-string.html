    <h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    JSLint and JSHint will throw the "Implied eval is evil. Pass a function instead of a string" error when they encounter <strong>a call to the <span class="code">setTimeout</span> or <span class="code">setInterval</span> functions in which the first argument is a string</strong>. Here's an example that should pop up a browser alert after one second:
</p>
<textarea>
/*jslint browser: true */
setTimeout("alert('Hello!');", 1000);</textarea>
<p>
    <h3>Why do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    This error is raised to highlight the use of a <strong>bad practice</strong> and a possible <strong>misunderstanding of the language</strong>. By passing a string to <span class="code">setTimeout</span> or <span class="code">setInterval</span> you are adding significant extra work for the engine. It has to parse that string as a complete program, akin to the <span class="code">eval</span> function. For full details of why this is a problem, see the article on the related message, "<a href="/eval-is-evil">eval is evil</a>".
</p>
<p>
    You can fix this issue by simply passing a function to <span class="code">setTimeout</span> or <span class="code">setInterval</span>. In a situation like that of the example above, you can achieve this by passing an anonymous function:
</p>
<textarea>
/*jslint browser: true, devel: true */
setTimeout(function () {
    "use strict";
    alert('Hello!');
}, 1000);</textarea>
