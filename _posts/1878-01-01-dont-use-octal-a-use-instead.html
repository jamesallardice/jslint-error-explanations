	<h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
	JSLint will throw the "Don't use octal: '{a}'. Use '\u...' instead" error when it encounters <strong>a string literal that contains the escape character followed by a digit between 0 and 7</strong>. In the following example we attempt to assign a string to a variable <span class="code">x</span>. The octal escape sequence <span class="code">\251</span> corresponds to the copyright symbol &copy;:
</p>
<textarea>
var x = "Copyright \251";</textarea>
<p>
	<h3>Why do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
	This error is raised to highlight <strong>the use of a deprecated language feature</strong>. As of version 5 of the ECMAScript specification, octal escape sequences are deprecated and should no longer be used. You run the risk of losing compatibility with newer JavaScript engines as support for this feature is gradually dropped.
</p>
<p>
	The latest version of the specification contains the following note (<a href="http://es5.github.com/#B.1" target="_blank">ES5 B.1</a>):
</p>
<blockquote>Past editions of ECMAScript have included additional syntax and semantics for specifying octal literals and octal escape sequences. These have been removed from this edition of ECMAScript.</blockquote>
<p>
	If you need to use an escape sequence, you can still use hexadecimal or unicode sequences. Both are still defined in ECMAScript 5 (<a href="http://es5.github.com/#A.1" target="_blank">ES5 A.1</a>):
</p>
<blockquote><em>EscapeSequence</em> <span class="code">::</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>CharacterEscapeSequence</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="code">0</span> [lookahead &#8713;<em>DecimalDigit</em>]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>HexEscapeSequence</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>UnicodeEscapeSequence</em></blockquote>
<p>
	JSLint recommends that you use the unicode escape sequence over the hexadecimal equivalent. The reason for this is likely that unicode escape sequences can cover a vast range of characters compared to the 256 offered by hexadecimal sequences, and that the JSON specification only allows unicode escapes. Note that although they have different names, both hexadecimal and unicode escape sequences use hexadecimal numbers. Here's the above example again, using a unicode escape instead:
</p>
<textarea>
var x = "Copyright \u00A9";</textarea>
<p>
	However, if you would rather use the hexadecimal escape sequence, JSLint will not throw any errors:
</p>
<textarea>
var x = "Copyright \xA9";</textarea>
