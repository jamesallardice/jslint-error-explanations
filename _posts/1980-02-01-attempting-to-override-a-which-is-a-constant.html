    <h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    JSHint will throw the "Attempting to override '{a}' which is a constant" error when it encounters an <strong>assignment to a constant that is not preceded by the <span class="code">const</span> keyword, when the <span class="code">esnext</span> option is set to <span class="code">true</span></strong>. In the following example we declare a constant <span class="code">MY_CONST</span> and assign a value to it, and then attempt to change its value:
</p>
<textarea data-linter="JSHint">
/*jshint esnext: true */
const MY_CONST = 10;
MY_CONST = 20;</textarea>
<p>
    <h3>Why do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    This error is raised to highlight a possible <strong>fatal JavaScript Type Error</strong>. Your code is likely to fail if you do not fix this issue.
</p>
<p>
    The current implementation of the <span class="code">const</span> statement is a Mozilla-specific extension. It is not found in the ECMAScript 5 specification and should not be relied upon for widespread support.
</p>
<p>
    The Mozilla Developer Network gives the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const" target="blank">following details for the <span class="code">const</span> keyword</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>The value of a constant cannot change through re-assignment, and a constant cannot be re-declared. Because of this, although it is possible to declare a constant without initializing it, it would be useless to do so.</blockquote>
<p>
    You can fix this issue by removing any assignments to constants declared with the <span class="code">const</span> keyword:
</p>
<textarea data-linter="JSHint">
/*jshint esnext: true */
const MY_CONST = 10;</textarea>
<p>
    However, since browser support for the <span class="code">const</span> statement is limited, and currently differs greatly in implementation, it's recommended that you don't use it all, and simply use the <span class="code">var</span> statement instead. A common convention to indicate a variable with a value that shouldn't change is to give that variable an identifier made up of uppercase characters, as has been done in the previous examples:
</p>
<textarea data-linter="JSHint">
var MY_CONST = 10; // A fake constant</textarea>
 <p class="standout">
    In JSHint 1.0.0 and above you have the ability to ignore any warning with a <a href="http://jshint.com/docs/#options" target="_blank">special option syntax</a>. Since this message relates to a fatal syntax error you cannot disable it.
