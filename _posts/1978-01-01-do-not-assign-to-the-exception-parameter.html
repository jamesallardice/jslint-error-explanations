    <h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    JSLint and JSHint will throw the "Do not assign to the exception parameter" error when they encounter <strong>an assignment inside a <span class="code">catch</span> block to the identifer associated with that block</strong>. In the following example we attempt to assign a new value to the exception parameter <span class="code">e</span>:
</p>
<textarea>
try {
    // Some code that might throw an exception
} catch (e) {
    e = 10;
}</textarea>
<p>
    <h3>Why do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    This error is raised to highlight <strong>a lack of convention</strong>. The obvious issue with assigning something to an exception parameter is that you lose access to the value passed to the <span class="code">catch</span> block completely. There is nothing like the <span class="code">arguments</span> object that will allow you to get back a reference to it. This could be confusing to other developers maintaining your code in the future.
</p>
<p>
    <h4>A note regarding the exception parameter</h4>
</p>
<p>
    According to the ECMAScript specification, a <span class="code">catch</span> block has its own lexical environment, which is created upon entering the block. The lexical environment maintains a reference to the lexical environment from which it was entered, which means you have access to variables defined in outer scopes. The lexical environment created when entering the <span class="code">catch</span> block gets a binding between the identifier and the exception value passed to the block (<a href="http://es5.github.com/#x12.14">ES5 &sect;12.14</a>):
</p>
<blockquote>The production <em>Catch</em> <span class="code">: catch (</span> <em>Identifier</em> <span class="code">)</span> <em>Block</em> is evaluated as follows:<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Let <em>C</em> be the parameter that has been passed to this production.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Let <em>oldEnv</em> be the running execution context’s LexicalEnvironment.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Let <em>catchEnv</em> be the result of calling NewDeclarativeEnvironment passing oldEnv as the argument.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Call the CreateMutableBinding concrete method of <em>catchEnv</em> passing the <em>Identifier</em> String value as the argument.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Call the SetMutableBinding concrete method of <em>catchEnv</em> passing the <em>Identifier</em>, <em>C</em>, and false as arguments...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Set the running execution context’s LexicalEnvironment to <em>catchEnv</em>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Let <em>B</em> be the result of evaluating <em>Block</em>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Set the running execution context’s LexicalEnvironment to <em>oldEnv</em>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. Return <em>B</em>.<br><br>
<strong>NOTE</strong> No matter how control leaves the <em>Block</em> the LexicalEnvironment is always restored to its former state.</blockquote>
<p>
    That note at the end is important. When the <span class="code">catch</span> block exits, we return to the original lexical environment. This means that the binding for the identifier in the <span class="code">catch</span> block will cease to exist (since the lexical environment that contained it no longer exists).
</p>
<p>
    However, in Internet Explorer 8 and below, the <span class="code">catch</span> block identifier leaks into the outer scope. In those browsers, you could accidently be assigning a value to the exception parameter, rather than a variable with the same identifier in an outer scope.

<p class="standout">
    In JSHint 1.0.0 and above you have the ability to ignore any warning with a <a href="http://jshint.com/docs/#options" target="_blank">special option syntax</a>. The identifier of this warning is <strong>W022</strong>. This means you can tell JSHint to not issue this warning with the <code>/*jshint -W022 */</code> directive.
