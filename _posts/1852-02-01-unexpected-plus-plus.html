    <h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    JSLint will throw the "Unexpected '++'" error when it encounters <strong>the use of the increment operator <span class="code">++</span></strong>. It will throw the related "Unexpected '--'" error when it encounters <strong>the use of the decrement operator <span class="code">++</span></strong> Here's an example:
</p>
<textarea>
var x = 1,
    y = 10;

x++;
y--;</textarea>

    This error message is perhaps the most debated of all JSLint error messages. It exists solely to warn you that JSLint has encountered a <strong>violation of a specific coding style</strong>, in particular, the style of the author of JSLint, Douglas Crockford. For his reasoning, you can read the <a href="http://www.jslint.com/lint.html#inc" target="_blank">JSLint documentation</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>The <span class="code">++</span> (increment) and <span class="code">--</span> (decrement) operators have been known to contribute to bad code by encouraging excessive trickiness. They are second only to faulty architecture in enabling to viruses and other security menaces. Also, preincrement/postincrement confusion can produce off-by-one errors that are extremely difficult to diagnose.</blockquote>

    There are many JavaScript developers who disagree with that, but the fact remains, it's a rule in JSLint so you need a way to work around it. What JSLint would prefer you to do is use the normal addition and subtraction operators, which can be combined with the assignment operator for a slight decrease in length:
</p>
<textarea>
var x = 1,
    y = 10;

x = x + 1; // or x += 1;
y = y - 1; // or y -= 1;</textarea>
<p>
    If you would prefer not to do that, and would rather stick with the normal increment and decrement operators, you can set the <span class="code">plusplus</span> option to <span class="code">true</span> to tell JSLint to allow them:
</p>
<textarea>
/*jslint plusplus: true */
var x = 1,
    y = 10;

x++;
y--;</textarea>
