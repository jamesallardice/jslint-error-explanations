    <h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    JSHint will throw the "Missing name in function declaration" error when it encounters <strong>the <span class="code">function</span> keyword, where it would be parsed as a statement, followed immediately by an opening parenthesis</strong>. In the following example we attempt to define a function but forget to give it an identifier.
</p>
<textarea data-linter="JSHint">
function () {
    "use strict";
}</textarea>
<p>
    This is the JSHint equivalent of the "<a href="/missing-name-in-function-statement">Missing name in function statement</a>" error from JSLint. More detail can be found on the page for the JSLint message.
</p>
<p class="standout">
    In JSHint 1.0.0 and above you have the ability to ignore any warning with a <a href="http://jshint.com/docs/#options" target="_blank">special option syntax</a>. The identifier of this warning is <strong>W025</strong>. This means you can tell JSHint to not issue this warning with the <code>/*jshint -W025 */</code> directive.
