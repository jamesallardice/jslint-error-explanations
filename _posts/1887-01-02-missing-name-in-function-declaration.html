    <h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    JSHint will throw the "Missing name in function declaration" error when it encounters <strong>the <span class="code">function</span> keyword, where it would be parsed as a statement, followed immediately by an opening parenthesis</strong>. In the following example we attempt to define a function but forget to give it an identifier.
</p>
<textarea>
function () {
    "use strict";
}</textarea>
<p>
    This is the JSHint equivalent of the "<a href="/missing-name-in-function-statement">Missing name in function statement</a>" error from JSLint. More detail can be found on the page for the JSLint message.
