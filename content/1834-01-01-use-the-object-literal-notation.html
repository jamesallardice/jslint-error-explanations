    <h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    JSLint and JSHint (before version 1.0.0) will throw the "Use the object literal notation {}" error when they encounter <strong>a call to the <span class="code">Object</span> constructor preceded by the <span class="code">new</span> operator</strong>. Here's an example:
</p>
<textarea>
var x = new Object();</textarea>
<p>
    <h3>Why do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    This error is raised to highlight a <strong>potentially dangerous and unnecessarily verbose piece of code</strong>. Before we look at why that above snippet is potentially dangerous, here's a rewritten version using array literal notation that passes JSLint and JSHint. Notice that it's significantly shorter:
</p>
<textarea>
var x = {};</textarea>
<p>
    Since the <span class="code">Object</span> constructor is actually just a property of the global object, it can be overwritten. If it has been overwritten, then it's possible the first example above will generate a type error. For example, if you had run something like <span class="code">Object = 50</span>, a type error would be thrown because <span class="code">Object</span> is no longer a function.
</p>
<p>
    Here's an example in which we overwrite the <span class="code">Object</span> constructor. Note that JSLint and JSHint do not know that's what has happened. Therefore, they take the safe approach and forbid the use of the <span class="code">Object</span> constructor completely:
</p>
<textarea data-jslintopts='{"browser":true}'>
window.Object = 50;
var x = new Object(); //TypeError: Object is not a function</textarea>
<p>
	Always using the literal form prevents running into problems like this, however unlikely they may be. Note that the literal form is identical to the constructor form (<a href="http://es5.github.com/#x11.1.5" target="_blank">ES5 &sect;11.1.5</a>):

<blockquote>The production <em>ObjectLiteral</em> <span class="code">: { }</span> is evaluated as follows:<br><br>

    In JSHint 1.0.0 and above this warning has changed to "<a href="/the-object-literal-notation-is-preferrable">The object literal notation {} is preferrable</a>". More detail can be found the page dedicated to that message.
