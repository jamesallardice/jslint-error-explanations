    <h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    JSLint (since July 2013) will throw the "Unexpected 'with'" error when it encounters <strong>a use of the <span class="code">with</span> statement</strong>. Prior to July 2013, the message was "Expected an identifier and instead saw 'with'", although the cause was identical. Here's an example:
</p>
<textarea>
function example() {
    var a = {
            b: 10
        },
        c = 20;
    with (a) {
        b = 30;
        c = 40;
    }
}</textarea>
<p>
    <h3>Why do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    The <span class="code">with</span> statement was designed to make it easier to access deeply nested object properties. In the example above, we don't have to write <span class="code">a.b</span> inside the <span class="code">with</span> statement, since the body of the statement is executed with an <em>augmented lexical environment</em> that causes the reference to <span class="code">b</span> to refer to a property of <span class="code">a</span>.
</p>
<p>
    In the example above, we attempt to set two properties of <span class="code">a</span> inside the <span class="code">with</span> statement. But <span class="code">a</span> doesn't have a property with the identifier <span class="code">c</span>. So instead of it being created, we are actually referring to the <span class="code">c</span> in the parent scope and accidentally change its value.
</p>
<p>
    This is the main reason the use of <span class="code">with</span> is discouraged. In fact, if your code is running in strict mode, any use of it will cause a syntax error (see the article regarding the related JSHint "<a href="/with-is-not-allowed-in-strict-mode">'with' is not allowed in strict mode</a>" message for more information). There are much better ways to achieve the same thing:
</p>
<textarea>
function example() {
    "use strict";
    var a = {
        b: 10
    };
    a.b = 30;
    a.c = 40;
}</textarea>
