    <h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    JSHint (version 1.0.0 and above) will throw the "Implied eval. Consider passing a function instead of a string" error when it encounters <strong>a call to the <span class="code">setTimeout</span> or <span class="code">setInterval</span> functions in which the first argument is a string</strong>. Here's an example that should pop up a browser alert after one second:
</p>
<textarea data-linter="JSHint">
setTimeout("alert('Hello!');", 1000);</textarea>
<p>
    This is the equivalent of the JSLint and older JSHint "<a href="/implied-eval-is-evil-pass-a-function-instead-of-a-string">Implied eval is evil. Pass a function instead of a string</a>" warning. More detail can be found on the page for that message.
</p>
<p class="standout">
    In JSHint 1.0.0 and above you have the ability to ignore any warning with a <a href="http://jshint.com/docs/#options" target="_blank">special option syntax</a>. The identifier of this warning is <strong>W066</strong>. This means you can tell JSHint to not issue this warning with the <code>/*jshint -W066 */</code> directive.
