    <h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    JSLint will throw the "Unexpected label '{a}'" error when it encounters <strong>a labelled statement whose statement is not an iteration or switch statement</strong> or <strong>a labelled statement in the global execution context</strong>. The following example contains a labelled <span class="code">var</span> statement:
</p>
<textarea>
function test() {
    "use strict";

labelled: //Label for the following var statement
    var x = 10;

}</textarea>
<p>
    <h3>Why do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    This error occurs in two different situations. Both require their own explanation.
</p>
<p>
    <h4>A labelled statement whose statement is not an iteration or switch statement</h4>
</p>
<p>
    The error is raised in this situation because JSLint has detected <strong>a completely useless and potentially confusing piece of code</strong>. According to the ECMAScript standard, any statement can be labelled. However, since the language does not define a <span class="code">goto</span> statement, labelled statements are only useful in conjunction with the <span class="code">break</span> and <span class="code">continue</span> statements, in the context of a loop or a switch.
</p>
<p>
    The specification sums this up in <a href="http://es5.github.com/#x12.12" target="_blank">section &sect;12.12</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
    A <em>Statement</em> may be prefixed by a label. Labelled statements are only used in conjunction with labelled <span class="code">break</span> and <span class="code">continue</span> statements. ECMAScript has no <span class="code">goto</span> statement.
</blockquote>
<p>
    Therefore, there is no reason at all to use a label unless it's labelling a <span class="code">for</span>, <span class="code">while</span>, <span class="code">do</span> or <span class="code">switch</span> statement.
<p>
    <h4>A labelled statement in the global execution context</h4>
</p>
<p>
    The error is raised in this situation because JSLint has detected <strong>a potentially confusing or dangerious piece of code</strong>. The same rules of the language (as detailed in the previous section) apply when the labelled statement occurs in the global execution context, but JSLint behaves slightly differently.
</p>
<p>
    JSLint disallows the use of any labelled statements in the global execution context, whether they are iteration/switch statements or not. This is in contrast to the behaviour inside a function context, where labelled iteration and switch statements <em>are</em> allowed. The reasoning behind this is unclear, but it's probably simply because in languages that support a <span class="code">goto</span> statement, labels in this sort of global scope would be very dangerous.
</p>
<p>
    Since there is no way to refer to a label apart from inside an iteration or switch statement with the <span class="code">break</span> or <span class="code">continue</span> statement, and since every statement has its own label set, there is no way for a label in the global scope to interfere with other code (you cannot for example overwrite a label defined elsewhere in the scope by defining one with the same identifier).
