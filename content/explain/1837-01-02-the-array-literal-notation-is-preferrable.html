    <h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    JSHint (version 1.0.0 and above) will throw the "The array literal notation [] is preferrable" error when it encounters <strong>a call to the <span class="code">Array</span> constructor preceded by the <span class="code">new</span> operator</strong>. Here's an example:
</p>
<textarea data-linter="JSHint">
var x = new Array();</textarea>
<p>
    This is the equivalent of the JSLint and older JSHint "<a href="/use-the-array-literal-notation">Use the array literal notation []</a>" warning. More detail can be found on the page for that message.
</p>
<p class="standout">
    In JSHint 1.0.0 and above you have the ability to ignore any warning with a <a href="http://jshint.com/docs/#options" target="_blank">special option syntax</a>. The identifier of this warning is <strong>W009</strong>. This means you can tell JSHint to not issue this warning with the <code>/*jshint -W009 */</code> directive.
