    <h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    JSLint (prior to version 2013-03-18) throws the "ADsafe violation: Misformed ADSAFE.go" error when the <span class="code">adsafe</span> and <span class="code">fragment</span> options are set to <span class="code">true</span> (they're <span class="code">false</span> by default) and <strong>the call to the <span class="code">ADSAFE.go</span> method does not pass the correct argument types</strong>. Here's an example:
</p>
<textarea data-jslintopts='{ "adsafe": true, "fragment": true }' data-file="jslint-20130205.min.js">
&lt;div id="WIDGET_"&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
        ADSAFE.go("WIDGET_");
    &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</textarea>
<p>
    <h3>Why do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    This error is raised when JSLint encounters code that <strong>violates the rules of the ADsafe subset of JavaScript</strong>. It is a fatal error that signifies a severe problem with ADsafe code and will have to be fixed before your ADsafe code will execute.
</p>
<p>
    The <span class="code">ADSAFE.go</span> method requires two arguments. The first must be the name of the widget, and the second must be a function. If the second argument is not passed in (it is <span class="code">undefined</span>) or is any type other than a function, JSLint will throw this error.

    In <a href="https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSLint/commit/267939b9168419312782a8533e35c60243215d56" target="_blank">a commit</a> on 20th March 2013, HTML, CSS and ADsafe parsing functionality was removed from JSLint. If you rely upon this functionality, you will be unable to upgrade JSLint to a version beyond that date.
