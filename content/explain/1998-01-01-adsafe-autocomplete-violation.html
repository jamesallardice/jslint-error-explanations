    <h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    JSLint (prior to version 2013-03-18) throws the "ADsafe autocomplete violation" error when the <span class="code">adsafe</span> and <span class="code">fragment</span> options are both set to <span class="code">true</span> (they're <span class="code">false</span> by default) and you pass it a fragment of HTML that contains <strong>an <span class="code">input</span> element with no <span class="code">autocomplete</span> attribute whose value is <span class="code">off</span></strong>. Here's an example:
</p>
<textarea data-jslintopts='{ "adsafe": true, "fragment": true }' data-file="jslint-20130205.min.js">
&lt;div id="WIDGET_"&gt;
    &lt;input type="text"&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
        ADSAFE.go("WIDGET_", function (dom) {
            "use strict";
        });
    &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</textarea>
<p>
    <h3>Why do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    This error is raised when JSLint encounters code that <strong>violates the rules of the ADsafe subset of JavaScript</strong>. It is a fatal error that signifies a severe problem with ADsafe code and will have to be fixed before your ADsafe code will execute.

    In <a href="https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSLint/commit/267939b9168419312782a8533e35c60243215d56" target="_blank">a commit</a> on 20th March 2013, HTML, CSS and ADsafe parsing functionality was removed from JSLint. If you rely upon this functionality, you will be unable to upgrade JSLint to a version beyond that date.
