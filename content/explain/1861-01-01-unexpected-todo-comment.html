    <h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    JSLint will throw the "Unexpected TODO comment" error when it encounters <strong>a comment in which the first word is "TODO"</strong>. Here's an example:
</p>
<textarea>
// TODO: Finish writing about JSLint errors</textarea>
<p>
    <h3>Why do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    This error is raised to highlight a <strong>lack of convention</strong>. Comments that start with the word "TODO" are commonly used to mark unfinished parts of code. JSLint takes the safe approach and assumes that your code is not production-ready if it contains such comments.
</p>
<p>
    If you are happy with "TODO" comments being in your code, you can pass the <span class="code">todo</span> option to JSLint to tell it to ignore them:
</p>
<textarea>
/*jslint todo: true */

// TODO: Finish writing about JSLint errors</textarea>
