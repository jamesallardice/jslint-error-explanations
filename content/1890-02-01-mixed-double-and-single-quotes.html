    <h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    JSHint (since version r09) will throw the "Mixed double and single quotes" error when it encounters a <strong>string literal delimited by double or single quote characters, when a string literal delimited by the other has already been encountered</strong>, but only when <strong><span class="code">quotmark</span> option is set to <span class="code">true</span></strong>. In the following example we attempt to assign string literals to the variables <span class="code">x</span> and <span class="code">y</span>:
</p>
<textarea data-linter="JSHint">
/*jshint quotmark:true */
var x = "My String",
    y = 'Another string';</textarea>
<p>
    <h3>Why do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    This error is raised to highlight a <strong>lack of consistency</strong>. There is no difference in JavaScript between single and double quotes. This is made clear by the grammar for string literals (<a href="http://es5.github.io/#x7.8.4" target="_blank">ES5 &sect;7.8.4</a>):
</p>
<blockquote><em>StringLiteral</em> ::<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="code">"</span> <em>DoubleStringCharacters</em><sub>opt</sub> <span class="code">"</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="code">'</span> <em>SingleStringCharacters</em><sub>opt</sub> <span class="code">'</span></blockquote>
<p>
    The only difference is that <em>DoubleStringCharacters</em> cannot contain another double quote, and <em>SingleStringCharacters</em> cannot contain a single quote (as that would terminate the string literal).
</p>
<p>
	However, it would usually be frowned upon to mix both types of quote within one program (there are obvious exceptions, such as nested quotes). You can easily resolve this issue by sticking to one type, and you should consider setting the <span class="code">quotmark</span> option to either <span class="code">double</span> or <span class="code">single</span> to enforce your preference:
<textarea data-linter="JSHint">
/*jshint quotmark:single */
var x = 'My String',
	y = 'Another string';</textarea>
<p class="standout">
    In JSHint 1.0.0 and above you have the ability to ignore any warning with a <a href="http://jshint.com/docs/#options" target="_blank">special option syntax</a>. The identifier of this warning is <strong>W110</strong>. This means you can tell JSHint to not issue this warning with the <code>/*jshint -W110 */</code> directive.
