    <h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    JSLint will throw the "'{a}' was used before it was defined" error when it encounters a reference to <strong>an identifier that has not been declared as part of a <span class="code">var</span> or <span class="code">function</span> statement</strong>. Some very common examples of this error are those that refer to native DOM objects:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>"'document' was used before it was defined"</li>
    <li>"'window' was used before it was defined"</li>
    <li>"'alert' was used before it was defined"</li>
    <li>"'console' was used before it was defined"</li>
    <li>"'require' was used before it was defined" (commonly seen with Node.js)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    In the following example we attempt to set the value of the variable <span class="code">x</span> that has not been defined, and then attempt to show the value of that variable in several ways. We also attempt to set the value of <span class="code">y</span> to the return value of a function which has not been defined:
</p>
<textarea>
var y = someFunction();
x = 10;
alert(x);
console.log(x);</textarea>

    <h3>Why do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    This error is raised to highlight <strong>potentially dangerous code</strong> or <strong>code that could cause a fatal error</strong>. Your code may run without error, depending on the identifier in question, but is likely to cause confusion to other developers and could in some cases cause a fatal error that will prevent the rest of your script from executing.
</p>
<p>
    The example above is valid JavaScript when not running in strict mode. It will create a property of the global object (in the browser, the global object is <span class="code">window</span>) with the given identifier. If you had accidentally omitted the <span class="code">var</span> keyword, you could have ended up overwriting a variable declared in a parent scope, causing unexpected behaviour. If it does run in strict mode, it will generate a <span class="code">ReferenceError</span> as it's illegal to assign a value to an undefined variable under such conditions (<a href="http://es5.github.com/#C" target="_blank">ES5 Annex C</a>):
</p>
<blockquote>Assignment to an undeclared identifier or otherwise unresolvable reference does not create a property in the global object. When a simple assignment occurs within strict mode code, its <em>LeftHandSide</em> must not evaluate to an unresolvable Reference. If it does a <span class="code">ReferenceError</span> exception is thrown.</blockquote>
<p>
    If you are referring to an identifier that has been declared elsewhere (perhaps in another JavaScript file included in a page), you can tell JSLint about it by using the <span class="code">global</span> directive:
</p>
<textarea>
/*global someFunction */
var y = someFunction();</textarea>
<p>
    If you have mistakenly omitted a <span class="code">var</span> keyword, you can fix this error by simply adding it in. If you omitted the keyword on purpose (perhaps to allow access to a variable from other scopes), declare the variable in the top-most scope in which it should be available:
</p>
<textarea>
var x = 10;</textarea>
<p>
    If the error is referring to a built-in DOM object, such as <span class="code">alert</span>, <span class="code">document</span> or <span class="code">window</span>, you can set some JSLint directives to make the parser aware of the fact that these built-in objects are actually available. Functions like <span class="code">alert</span> are treated as debugging aids by JSLint. You can use the <span class="code">devel</span> option to prevent warnings concerning these:
</p>
<textarea>
/*jslint devel: true */
var x = 10;
alert(x);</textarea>
<p>
    Other common browser built-ins can be pre-defined with the use of the <span class="code">browser</span> option:
</p>
<textarea>
/*jslint browser: true */
var elem = document.createElement("div");</textarea>
<p>
    Finally, common Node.js built-ins can be pre-defined with the use of the <span class="code">node</span> option:
</p>
<textarea>
/*jslint node: true */
var http = require("http");</textarea>
