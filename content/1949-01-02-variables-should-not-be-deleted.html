    <h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    JSHint will throw the "Variables should not be deleted" error when it encounters <strong>the <span class="code">delete</span> operator when its operand does not appear to be an object property</strong>. In the following example we declare a variable <span class="code">x</span> and then attempt to delete it:
</p>
<textarea data-linter="JSHint">
var x = 10;
delete x;</textarea>
<p>
    This is the JSHint equivalent of the "<a href="/only-properties-should-be-deleted">Only properties should be deleted</a>" error from JSLint. More detail can be found on the page for the JSLint message.
</p>
<p class="standout">
    In JSHint 1.0.0 and above you have the ability to ignore any warning with a <a href="http://jshint.com/docs/#options" target="_blank">special option syntax</a>. The identifier of this warning is <strong>W051</strong>. This means you can tell JSHint to not issue this warning with the <code>/*jshint -W051 */</code> directive.
