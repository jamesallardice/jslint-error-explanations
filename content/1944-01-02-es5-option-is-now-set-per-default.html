    <h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    JSHint (since version 2.0.0) will throw the "ES5 option is now set per default" error when it encounters <strong>the <span class="code">es5</span> JSHint option with a value of <span class="code">true</span></strong>. Here's an example in which we set the <span class="code">es5</span> option so we can use reserved words as property identifers (which was not allowed in ES3):
</p>
<textarea data-linter="JSHint">
/*jshint es5: true */
var x = {
    default: 10
};</textarea>
<p>
    <h3>Why do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    This error is rasied to highlight a <strong>pointless piece of code</strong>. If you're using JSHint 2.0.0 or above, the <span class="code">es5</span> option will be set to <span class="code">true</span> by default, due to the fact that environments supporting the ES5 spec are now far more widespread.
</p>
<p>
    You can simply remove the option from any JSHint directives or <em>.jshintrc</em> files. Select JSHint version 1.1.0 or below in the following example to see the difference from when the <span class="code">es5</span> option was not on by default:
</p>
<textarea data-linter="JSHint">
var x = {
    default: 10
};</textarea>
</p>
 <p class="standout">
    In JSHint 1.0.0 and above you have the ability to ignore any warning with a <a href="http://jshint.com/docs/#options" target="_blank">special option syntax</a>. Since this is an informational JSHint message, it cannot be disabled.
